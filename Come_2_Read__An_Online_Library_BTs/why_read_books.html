        <p>Even if you have read one good book in your life, you will know what 
        reading gives. It gives you incomparable pleasure. While there is no 
        doubt about the fact that reading is a priceless activity, it has been 
        observed that the habit of reading has declined of late. One of the main
        causes for this decline is the growth of technology. However, what most
        people don’t know is there is so much to benefit from reading. Here are
        10 reasons of reading books:</p>

    <h3>Gives knowledge</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Gives knowledge</strong></p>
        <p>One of the biggest reasons why we read books is to gain knowledge. 
        Books are a rich source of information. Reading books on varied subjects
        imparts information and increases the depth about the subject as well. 
        Whenever you read a book, you learn a new information that otherwise 
        would not have known.</p>

    <h3>Improves your brain</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Improves your brain</strong></p>
        <p>Studies have shown that reading has strong positive effects on the 
        brain. By staying mentally stimulated, you can prevent dementia and 
        Alzheimer’s disease. This is because, keeping your brain active prevents
        it from losing power. The brain is a muscle and like other muscles in 
        the body, exercise keeps it strong and healthy. Similar to solving 
        puzzles, reading books is a great way to exercise your brain and keep it
        healthy.</p>

    <div class="percent">3</div>
    
    <h3>Reduces stress</h3>
    
    </div>
	
    <div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Reduces stress</strong></p>
        <p>Reading has a positive effect on the body as well. Reading a book can
        relieve stress better than taking a walk or listening to music. 
        According to studies who read more tend to have lower stress levels.</p>

    <div id="left">
    
    <div class="percent">4</div>
	
    <h3>Improves memory</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Improves memory</strong></p>
        <p>Every time you read a book, you have to remember the setting of the 
        book, the characters, their backgrounds, their history, their 
        personalities, the sub-plots and so much more. As your brain learns to 
        remember all this, your memory becomes better. What’s more, with every 
        new memory you create, you create new pathways and this strengthens the 
        existing ones.</p>

    <div id="left">
    
    <div class="percent">5</div>
	
    <h3>Improves imagination</h3>
    
    </div>
    
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Improves imagination</strong></p>
        <p>The more you read, the more imaginative you become. Whenever you read
        a fiction book, it takes you another world. In the new world, your 
        imagination works at its best as you try to see things in your own mind.</p>

	</div>
    
    <div id="left">
    
    <div class="percent">6</div>
	
    <h3>Develops critical thinking skills</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Develops critical thinking skills</strong></p>
        <p>One of the primary benefits of reading books is its ability to 
        develop critical thinking skills. For example, reading a mystery novel 
        sharpens your mind. Critical thinking skills are crucial when it comes 
        to making important day to day decisions. Reading requires an individual
        to think and process information in a way that watching television 
        can’t. The more you read, the deeper your understanding becomes about 
        what you’re reading and its application.</p>

	<h3>Builds vocabulary</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Builds vocabulary</strong></p>
        <p>Reading improves your vocabulary and command on the language. As you 
        read, you come across new words, idioms, new words, phrases and writing 
        styles.</p>

	</div>
    
    <div id="left">
    
    <div class="percent">8</div>
	
    <h3>Improves writing skills</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Improves writing skills</strong></p>
        <p>Reading a well-written book affects your ability to become a better 
        writer. Just like artists influence others, so do writers. Many 
        successful authors gained their expertise by reading the works of 
        others. So, if you want to become a better writer, start by learning 
        from previous masters.</p>

	</div>
    
    <div id="left">
    
    <div class="percent">9</div>
    
	<h3>Improves communication skills</h3>
    
    </div>
	
    <div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Improves communication skills</strong></p>
        <p>Improving your vocabulary and writing skills goes hand in hand with 
        developing your communication skills. The more you read and write, the 
        better you communicate. Increasing your ability to communicate, improves
        your relationships and even makes you a better employee or student.</p>

	</div>
    
    <div id="left">
    
    <div class="percent">10</div>
    
	<h3>Improves focus and concentration</h3>
    
    </div>
				
	<div id="right">
				
        <p><strong>Improves focus and concentration</strong></p>
        <p>In our busy lifestyles, our attention is drawn in different 
        directions each day as we try to multi-task through each day. For 
        example, you may find yourself dividing your time between working on a 
        task, chatting with people via Skype, checking email, keeping an eye on 
        Facebook and interacting with your colleagues. All this multi-tasking 
        can lead to high stress level and low productivity. When you read a 
        book, all your attention is focused on what you’re reading. Your eyes 
        and thoughts are immersed in the details of the story. This improves 
        your concentration and focus. Read a book at least 20 minutes a day, and
        you will be amazed at how much more focused you will be.</p>
