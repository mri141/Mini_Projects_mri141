                        from time to time, and incorporated by reference in this Agreement. As of March 2019, there
                        exist 2 (two) types of Accounts under ClickDealer Affiliate Program - 'Regular' and 'Smartlink
                        Only'. Holders of the latter shall only have access to ClickDealer Smartlink(s) and will not be

                        for an account type change and will have to undergo an approval procedure (provide additional
                        information on promotion methods and/or identity, and complete an interview with a ClickDealer
                        representative).

                        any additional account must be expressly preapproved with a ClickDealer representative in
                        writing. If at any time ClickDealer becomes aware of more than one account related to one and
                        the same private individual or legal entity, created to deceive ClickDealer or its partners,
                        ClickDealer may restrict, deny or terminate such accounts and/or any benefits derived from such
                        accounts; ClickDealer may also withhold payment of any commissions and/or other fees related to

                        unsuitable.

                        does not in any way create a partnership, nor have the parties granted to each other any right
                        or authority to assume or create any obligation of responsibility, express or implied, on behalf
                        of or in the name of the other, or to bind the other in any manner whatsoever.

                    <p>
                        3.6 It is further agreed that the Affiliate has no authority to create or assume in
                        ClickDealer's name or on its behalf any obligation, express or implied, or to act or purport to
                        act as its agent or representative for any purpose whatsoever and the Affiliate shall not hold
                        itself out as having any such authority.
                    </p>
                    <p> 3.7 ClickDealer may, in its sole discretion, confirm or otherwise verify or check, the truth and
                        accuracy of any registration information provided by Affiliate. The Affiliate hereby covenants
                        and guarantees to provide to ClickDealer only the truthful and valid information regarding the
                        Affiliate's identity and location; in case ClickDealer or third-party payment provider requests
                        the Affiliate to prove its identity and location, the Affiliate shall reply within 2 (two)
                        business days from the day of request and provide valid proof of its identity and location. If
                        at any time ClickDealer, in its sole judgment and discretion, determines the Affiliate’s
                        registration information to be misleading, inaccurate or untruthful, ClickDealer may restrict,
                        deny or terminate Affiliate’s account, Affiliate’s access and use of, and/or any benefits
                        derived from Affiliate’s participation in the Program; ClickDealer may also withhold payment of
                        any commissions and/or other fees that may be or become due or payable to Affiliate.
                    </p>
                    <p> 3.8 Affiliate will be solely responsible for the development, operation, and maintenance of the
                        Affiliate website and for all materials that appear on the Affiliate website. Such
                        responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the technical operation of the Affiliate
                        website and all related equipment; creating and posting product reviews, descriptions, and
                        references on the Affiliate website and linking those descriptions to the Program Site; the
                        accuracy and propriety of materials posted on the Affiliate website; and ensuring that materials
                        posted on the Affiliate website do not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party
                        and are not libelous or otherwise illegal. ClickDealer disclaims all liability and
                        responsibility for such matters.
                    </p>
                    <p> 3.9 Other than as provided in this Section 3, Affiliate may not sublease, rent, lease, sell,
                        resell, outsource or service any Offer, and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.

                        an Affiliate provided a non-existent email or missed a notification, ClickDealer shall not be
                        liable for any losses resulting thereof. By default, any Affiliate account is subscribed to

                        Site. ClickDealer applies either monthly NET 15 or weekly NET 7 payment plans at its sole
                        discretion, unless mutually agreed otherwise. Notwithstanding of the selected payment method
                        (e.g. paypal, payoneer, webmoney etc.) the Affiliate shall provide ClickDealer with their actual
                        bank details. </p>
                    <p>6.2 Commissions will be paid to the Affiliate only following receipt by ClickDealer of payment
                        from the Client in respect of such Offer published in the Program online reporting system.
                        ClickDealer may, in its sole discretion and from time to time, elect to advance to the Affiliate
                        part or all of the Commissions prior to receipt of payment from the Client, but in no event will
                        ClickDealer be obligated to do so. ClickDealer may offer weekly payments to trusted Affiliates
                        with proven traffic quality, whose earnings exceed a weekly threshold of $1'000.00 (One Thousand
                        US dollars) for Regular Account holders and $500 (Five Hundred US dollars) for Smartlink Only
                        Account holders but reserves the right to deny weekly payments to any Affiliate at its own
                        discretion. An Affiliate can request its Account type switch only once, and only for the reason
                        of accessing specific offers. If an Affiliate is caught requesting its Account type switch in
                        order to manipulate ClickDealer into faster payments, ClickDealer reserves the right to deny
                        such application and, if such requests persist, to terminate the Affiliate Account. </p>
                    <p> 6.4 Minimum amount that can be paid to the Affiliate in a given billing period must exceed
                        $500.00 (five hundred US dollars) for Regular Affiliate Account holders and $100.00 (one hundred
                        US dollars) for Smartlink Only account holders, regardless of the selected payment currency.
                        Payment in the amount less than the respective threshold, but not less than $100.00 (one hundred
                        US dollars), is possible in case of termination of the Agreement mutually agreed by the parties
                        or its cancelation that is not related to any breach of contractual provisions or applicable
                        laws by the Affiliate, or upon individual agreement between the parties.</p>
                    <p>6.5 Commissions due and payable by ClickDealer to an Affiliate will not accrue interest. </p>
                    <p> 6.6 Payments to an Affiliate in accordance with this Section will be based upon the records kept
                        by ClickDealer and reported in ClickDealer’s online reporting system and audited by the Clients,
                        from time to time.</p>
                    <p>6.7 In case the Affiliate's account is not active for a period of 12 (twelve) months and the
                        Affiliate didn’t request the payment of its Commissions within these 12 (twelve) months, any and
                        all Commission may be then deemed as void and written off the balance, as well as the account
                        may be terminated.</p>

                        Program through a unique referral link received from ClickDealer, the Affiliate will have the
                        right to be paid 2% (2 per cent) of the referred Affiliate's earnings for 6 months from the date
                        referral relations are established (unless other terms were agreed upon individually).
                    </p>
                    <p> 7.2 For this purpose, the Parties agree that only the newly referred Affiliates will be eligible
                        for ClickDealer Referral Program and that no individuals or companies with pre-existing accounts
                        shall be considered eligible for the effect.</p>
                    <p>7.3 Referral commissions start to accrue when the Referred Affiliate(s) bills get paid, not on

                    <p>7.4 Referral commissions can be withdrawn as soon as the minimum threshold of $100 is reached and
                        will be added to the Affiliate's next bill.

                        engaged in any activity that ClickDealer considers to be fraudulent or which might bring the
                        reputation or standing of ClickDealer into disrepute either with the general public or with the
                        Clients or potential Clients of ClickDealer, or otherwise that the Affiliate or Sub-Affiliate
                        has engaged in activities which might be considered fraudulent or in case the Affiliate violates
                        any given Offer's promotion restrictions, ClickDealer may but will not be obligated to: (i)
                        suspend or terminate the Affiliate’s membership in the Program, without notice and (ii) release
                        to a regulatory body or any governmental authority, information relating to the identity and
                        location of the Affiliate if required to do so in order to comply with existing legislation.
                    </p>
                    <p>9.2 ClickDealer may but will not be obliged to provide proof of fraudulent activity to the
                        Affiliate, and proof of any share of traffic being fraudulent is reason enough to forfeit the
                        whole commission that is due to the Affiliate. If an Affiliate feels ClickDealer's judgement in
                        determining illegitimacy of its traffic to be wrong, the Affiliate shall provide proof of the
                        opposite by sharing access to its traffic source/tracker, providing creative material used for
                        promotion of the given campaign or any other evidence that the Affiliate hasn't been engaged in
                        fraudulent activities. If the Affiliate fails to provide satisfactory or any kind of such proof
                        within 7 (seven) days of its payment being put on hold, ClickDealer reserves the right to
                        terminate its Affiliate Account and cancel payment of the applicable commissions, at its sole
                        discretion and without any further obligations to the Affiliate.

                    <p>9.3 In the event of suspension or termination in accordance with paragraph 9.1 above, any
                        Commission due and payable to the Affiliate in accordance with Section 6 at the time of
                        suspension or termination will be deemed to be forfeited.</p>
                    <p>9.4 For the purposes of this Agreement, fraudulent activity includes but is in no way limited to:
