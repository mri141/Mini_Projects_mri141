                    <p>3.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and provided that the IO has been
                        approved by ClickDealer in writing, ClickDealer hereby undertakes to embark on all commercially
                        reasonable efforts to supply the services and to undertake the campaign as described in the IO
                        (collectively referred to as the “Campaign(s)”).</p>
                    <p>3.3 ClickDealer does not guarantee the placement, positioning or the timing of delivery of any
                        Advertising Material, or the certain quantity and quality of Traffic, publications, conversions
                        or clicks on any Advertising Material. The promoting, positioning and distribution of the
                        Advertising Material shall be at the sole discretion of ClickDealer, unless such timing,
                        positioning and distribution is specifically provided for in the IO and agreed between the
                        parties, and ClickDealer will not be prohibited from also carrying Advertising Material for any
                        product or business competitive to the product or business of the Advertiser.</p>
                    <p>3.4 ClickDealer reserves at any time the right to reject, suspend or cancel any Campaign and/or
                        to reject any Advertising Material which in the opinion and/or discretion of ClickDealer is not
                        deemed suitable and appropriate for publication for any reason. ClickDealer reserves the right
                        to reject, suspend, postpone or cancel any Advertising Material which in the opinion of
                        ClickDealer may expose ClickDealer into criminal and/or civil liability and/or any other form of
                        liability. Furthermore, ClickDealer might refuse, reject, suspend or cancel any Campaign if in
                        its opinion it is deemed to be offensive or objectionable.</p>

                    <p>4.1 For these services to be rendered by ClickDealer, the Advertiser hereby pledges, covenants
                        and agrees to pay to ClickDealer for all the transactions generated by ClickDealer, regardless
                        of the campaign term set out in the IO, and any additional payments which are to be agreed upon
                        between the parties.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.2 For the purpose of effecting payments, the Advertiser shall provide ClickDealer with reported
                        numbers and statistics within 5 (five) business days after each billable month or any other
                        billing period agreed upon between the parties. If Advertiser fails to provide ClickDealer with
                        the reported numbers within the aforesaid timeframe, then ClickDealer shall issue and send an
                        invoice based on ClickDealer’s reported numbers. ClickDealer reserves the right to dispute the
                        Advertiser’s reported numbers within the 5 (five) business days from the date of receipt of
                        reported numbers from the Advertiser. In case of discrepancies, reported numbers from
                        ClickDealer’s tracking platform shall prevail unless the Advertiser can soundly prove the
                        discrepancy arose from ClickDealer’s own mistake. After agreeing upon the reported numbers,
                        ClickDealer shall provide the Advertiser with invoices at monthly intervals, or at any other
                        such intervals which are set forth in the IO and/or agreed between the parties. The Advertiser
                        hereby promises, agrees and covenants to effect payment of the amounts mentioned in the
                        invoices. Such amounts may include – without limitation – all applicable and pertinent sales,
                        use, excise and/or any other taxes, without set-off. Such amounts might also include abatements,
                        compensations or deductions, all in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
                        additional terms set out in the IO. Payment, shall be made to ClickDealer within 15 (fifteen)
                        calendar days, unless different payment terms have been agreed upon by the parties in the
                        applicable IO, from the date that the invoice is issued and sent by ClickDealer to the
                        Advertiser.</p>
                    <p>4.4 The Advertiser acknowledges and agrees that any credit card and related billing and any other
                        payment information that the Advertiser provides to ClickDealer may be shared with companies who
                        work on our behalf such as payment processors and/or credit agencies solely for the purpose of
                        checking credit and/or effecting payment to ClickDealer and serving the Advertiser’s account.
                        ClickDealer shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of such information by such third
                        party.</p>

                        deemed suitable and appropriate for publication for any reason. Furthermore, ClickDealer
                        reserves the right to reject, suspend, postpone or cancel any advertisement, which in the
                        opinion of ClickDealer may expose ClickDealer into criminal and/or civil liability and/or any
                        other form of liability. Furthermore, ClickDealer might refuse, reject, suspend or cancel any
                        Campaign if in its opinion it is deemed to be offensive or objectionable.
